Computer Science Topics 
----

> This guide main goal is gather the main headlines in computer science, so you can look up many fields as possible. (Cause you don't know what you don't know) 

What should you do with the main topic names, is to put the name into Google, followed by `tutorial` or `course`, for example: `JavaScript tutorial` or `learn git`, or search directly in YouTube where you will find many tutorials about the thing you are looking for. 

### First thing to start with if you have no knowledge with computer science would be to look up `Introduction to Computer Science` by any established university, example: [MIT's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6U-i4gXkLM)
